Work with headquarters’ scientists, technical advisors, and country teams to implement, manage, and conduct research studies in global health. Project highlights:\n·Microbicide Research and Development to Advance HIV Prevention and Technologies (MATRIX) project (https://matrix4prevention.org/).\no   Manage a multi-national survey (Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) on women’ values and preferences on new HIV-prevention products. Work with four country teams (KEMRI, Wits RHI, HSRC, and PZAT) to submit protocol to IRBs, develop survey’s standard operating procedures, and implement the survey following proposed timeline.\no   Program the survey in ODK (with randomization and embedded media).\no   Conducted in-person data collection training in Nairobi, Kenya, Johannesburg and Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.\no   Monitor survey data (in R) and provide rapid feedback to country teams.  \no   Develop a statistical analysis plan for a Latent Class Analysis to categorize survey’s participants into distinct end-user segments based on their expressed preferences for HIV prevention products under development with MATRIX. Description of end-user’s segments and their feedback will be shared with product developers.  \n· Viet Nam’s End TB program: Clean, analyze, and synthesize programmatic data, comparing results from Artificial Intelligence software with radiologists to provide insight on implementation strategies and scale-up. Analytic methods used (in R and Stata): Interrupted time series, receiver operating characteristics.\n· Systematic Reviews:\no   Conduct various systematic reviews, including a meta-analysis (in R), on different HIV-prevention topics for publication.\no   Conduct rapid systematic reviews to assess how effective GAVI-funded pro-equity interventions are at identifying, reach, monitoring and measuring, or advocating for missed communities and zero-dose children.

However, as of summer 2023, the average vaccination rate is still low, only at around 16%. Figure 4 summarizes the average COVID-19 vaccination rates of all races/ethnicitity groups during this time frame. Asian is the race group that has the highest vaccination rate, at around 23 %, higher than the national average at around 12.5%. The vaccination rate is lowest among Black population, only at around 5%. This finding aligns with the results from KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, which shows that 35% of Black adults expressed hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination [2]. History of racial discrimination in healthcare and medical research as well as in the criminal justic system may contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Black adults [3]. Public health officials should listen to concerns about COVID-19 vaccination from this population and address them with cultural appropriate health communication messages."
