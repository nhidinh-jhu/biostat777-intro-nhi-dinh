## Research Question

How do the COVID-19 vaccination rates vary among pregnant people aged 18-49 change from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 and by race/ethnicity?

## Intended audience

Public health officials who will make decision on which group to prioritize for COVID-19 vaccination campaign targeting pregnant people.

## Data sources

This dataset comes from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). It includes estimates on COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant persons, overall and by race and ethnicity based on data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink \[1\].

## Results

The COVID-19 vaccination rates among pregnant people (aged 18-45) across all races and ethnicities increased from 2022 to 2023 (Figures 1), with most groups increased sharply from September 2022 to January 2023, then even out. However, as of summer 2023, the average vaccination rate is still low, only at around 16%. Figure 4 summarizes the average COVID-19 vaccination rates of all races/ethnicitity groups during this time frame. Asian is the race group that has the highest vaccination rate, at around 23 %, higher than the national average at around 12.5%. The vaccination rate is lowest among Black population, only at around 5%. This finding aligns with the results from KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, which shows that 35% of Black adults expressed hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination \[2\]. History of racial discrimination in healthcare and medical research as well as in the criminal justic system may contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Black adults \[3\]. Public health officials should listen to concerns about COVID-19 vaccination from this population and address them with cultural appropriate health communication messages.
