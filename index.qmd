Hi!

My name is Nhi Dinh and I am a first-year PhD student in Global Disease Epidemiology and Control (International Health Department). I am from Ha Noi, Viet Nam, and I consider the U.S. (especially the DMV area) my second home. I love to travel and I always look for an excuse to plan my next trip! Here is a photo from my most recent trip (pre-PhD retreat) to Iceland.
